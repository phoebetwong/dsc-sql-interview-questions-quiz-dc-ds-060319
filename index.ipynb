    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "text, integer, real, and blob. Yes SQLite support other common datatypes like int _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "primary keys in a table uniquely identify a row. foreign keys is not the primary key of a particular table, but a key in another table that can be used as a key in joining. e.g. in a table with sales employees of a company, the employee number would be the primary key, and the employee number in the customer table would be a foreign key that is unlikely to uniquely identify each row because each salesperson is likely to have multiple customers. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "inner join (default): intersaction between two tables, i.e. only rows with entries and key in both tables will be joined. \n",
    "left join: only rows with entries in the left table will be joined\n",
    "left outer join: only rows with entries in the left table that doesn't have entries in the right table will be joined\n",
    "outer join: all entries from left and right table will be joiend.\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "aggregate functions with group by statements return the values of a variable aggregated by the groups specified in the group by statement. e.g. in a table with gender and salary, sum(salary) group by (gender) will return the aggregate salary of each gender group\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "in a many to many join, multiple entries in one table are joined by multiple entries in another table, causing the resulting set size to multiply. e.g. when joining a table with offices in each state is joined with a table with all pizza restaurants in each state, each office in a state will be matched with corresponding \n",
